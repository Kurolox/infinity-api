# Infinity API
## An open-source API for [Infinity: The Game](https://infinitythegame.com/)

This project's goal is to offer an easily accesible, constantly updated API to all the game data related to the Corvus Belli Wargame, infinity: The Game.

## Features

This API currently provides the following resources:

- All the units in the game, and their different profiles
- All the weapons in the game
- Every ability, ammo type, characteristic and keyword
- Support for all the translated languages (English, Spanish and French)

In addition, since all the data is fetched directly from the [Infinity army builder](), the data is constantly updated without any need to manually add entries
